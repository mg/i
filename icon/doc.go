// The Iterator Containers (icon) package provides iterators that give access to containers such as slices.
// Each slices iterator is a typed variand supporting the corresponding typed
// interface in ityped, e.g. the iterator for boolean slices returns the
// ityped.RandomAccessBool interface, which in addition to the general
// i.RandomAccess interface supports the Bool() bool method, which returns
// the current value as a boolean type.
//
// The following typed slices are supported: bool, byte, complex64, complex128,
// float32, float64, int, int8, int16, int32, int64, rune, string, uint, uint8,
// uint16, uint32, uint64.
//
// The typed iterators for each type can be constructed in two ways, eitther
// from a typed slice (e.g. Bool([]bool{ boolean values...})) or with a variable
// argument function (e.g. BoolList(boolean values...)).
//
// The iterator for the generic interface{} can be constructed from a slice of
// interfaces with the Interfaces([]interface{interface values...}) function or
// the List function (List(values)).
